rounded-loading-spinner
=======================

Hide those rough transparent GIF edges for rounded loaders.

You can easily remove the modal overlay if you want to have the loader inline in your app.

The image can be swapped easily (though be sure to change the sizes in the styles) and the transition time is easy to change. I have it set to one second for dramatic demo effect.

This does not require any JS to work. It is all CSS and HTML. You just need to be able to add the class "show-rounded-loading-spinner" to show the loader and remove that class to hide it.

I have added some simple jQuery to show how it works.
